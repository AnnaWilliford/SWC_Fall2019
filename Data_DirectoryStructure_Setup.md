# Please follow this link to download `SCW` folder for this workshop

- [x] Download SCW.zip:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/utacarpentries/2019-02-23-UTA/gh-pages/data/Data.zip
- [x] Unzip and add `SCW` folder to Desktop.

The folder `SCW` should contain the following folders:

Data
Data_Copy
Lesson1_UnixShell
Lesson2_IntroToR
Lesson3_Git_GitHub
Lesson4_ProgrammingR
Lesson5_DataVisualizationR
Lesson6_ReproducibleResearchR

`Data` and `Data_Copy` contain data we will be using during this workshop. 
`Data_Copy` should be used in case you accidentally delete files in `Data` folder.
This is a backup data folder, it is always a good practice to keep your original raw data in a separate 'safe' folder
